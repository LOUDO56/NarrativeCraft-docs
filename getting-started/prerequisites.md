# Prerequisites

## Basic Knowledge of Ink

Ink has its own official [documentation](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md).  
You don’t need to learn the advanced features for now.

This documentation will give you a basic understanding of how Ink works, so you can easily follow along with NarrativeCraft’s documentation.

## Inky

To write your story and handle scripting, you’ll want to install [Inky](https://github.com/inkle/inky/releases).

Inky is an IDE with several features that help you write your story and manage multiple files within the same project.

::: tip
Associate `.ink` files with Inky for easier access.
