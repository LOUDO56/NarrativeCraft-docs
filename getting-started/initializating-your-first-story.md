# Initializing a Story

Now that you have a basic understanding of Ink, let's explore how to create a story and use NarrativeCraft.

## Joining a World

Each world has its own unique story. To initialize a story for the first time, create a new world or join an existing one you haven’t entered before using NarrativeCraft.

When joining a world, if you see this message, the mod has been initialized and a directory called `narrativecraft` has been created in your world folder.

## Entering the Development Environment

If you join a world that has already been initialized by NarrativeCraft, you’ll start on the main menu.  
However, this menu is intended for regular players.

To exit this menu and enter development mode, press Left CTRL five times. A "Dev Environment" button will appear.
