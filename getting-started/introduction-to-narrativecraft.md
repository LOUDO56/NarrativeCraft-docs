# Introduction to NarrativeCraft

## What is NarrativeCraft?

Imagine creating your own narrative game like a Life Is Strange or Until Then, this mod provides you everything to start creating a solo interactive game without any code knowledge.

Plus, you don't need to create everything from scratch, you have a 3D world, characters, shaders, resource packs, datapacks, other minecraft mods to create the perfect mood for your story

## How Does This Mod Work?

NarrativeCraft exists thanks to the open-source project [Ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink), a narrative scripting language created by [Inkle](https://www.inklestudios.com) for writing interactive stories.  
Itâ€™s designed to be easy to learn and no-code friendly, while offering enough powerful features for advanced structuring.

The Java adaptation of Ink was developed by [bladecoder](https://github.com/bladecoder).

NarrativeCraft builds upon the work of Ink and bladecoder to make interactive storytelling possible within Minecraft.
