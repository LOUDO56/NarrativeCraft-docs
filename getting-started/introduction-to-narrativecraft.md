# Introduction to NarrativeCraft

## What is NarrativeCraft?

NarrativeCraft is a Minecraft mod that turns Minecraft into a sort of game-engine where you can create narrative stories with choices and patterns based on choices.

It's mostly for creating a game in a game and is highly inspired from games I love like Life Is Strange and Until Then.

It's all-in-one (recording, cutscene, rendering dialogs, story management) and is designed to be easy to use.

## How Does This Mod Work?

NarrativeCraft exists thanks to the open-source project [Ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink), a narrative scripting language created by [Inkle](https://www.inklestudios.com) for writing interactive stories.  
It’s designed to be easy to learn and no-code friendly, while offering enough powerful features for advanced structuring.

The Java adaptation of Ink was developed by [bladecoder](https://github.com/bladecoder).

NarrativeCraft builds upon the work of Ink and bladecoder to make interactive storytelling possible within Minecraft.
