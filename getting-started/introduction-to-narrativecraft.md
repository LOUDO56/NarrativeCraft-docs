# Introduction to NarrativeCraft

## What is NarrativeCraft?

NarrativeCraft is a Minecraft mod that allows you to easily create interactive stories directly within the game.  
Writing a story is one thing, but bringing it to life can be an entirely different task, especially when it involves creating all the assets yourself.

NarrativeCraft helps bring your ideas to life using Minecraft's default assets. Additionally, you can enhance your story with custom resource packs, other mods, or shaders to give it a truly unique atmosphere.

## How Does This Mod Work?

NarrativeCraft exists thanks to the open-source project [Ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink), a narrative scripting language created by [Inkle](https://www.inklestudios.com) for writing interactive stories.  
Itâ€™s designed to be easy to learn and no-code friendly, while offering enough powerful features for advanced structuring.

The Java adaptation of Ink was developed by [bladecoder](https://github.com/bladecoder).

NarrativeCraft builds upon the work of Ink and bladecoder to make interactive storytelling possible within Minecraft.
