# Logo

In NarrativeCraft, you can display a logo that represents your story.  
To set it, place your `.png` file at the exact path:  
`textures/narrativecraft_logo.png`

The logo will appear in the [Main Screen](/customizations/main-menu) and the [Credits](/customizations/credits).

Example:  
![Main screen with logo image](/assets/customizations/main-menu/main-menu-with-logo.png)
