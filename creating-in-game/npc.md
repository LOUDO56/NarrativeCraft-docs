# NPC

For temporary characters used in a specific scene, you can create an NPC by going to the scene menu and selecting "Npc", then adding one.

An NPC works like a global character but without a defined identity.  
To change its skin, go to the character folder within your scene and replace the `main.png` file.  
(Optional skins are not supported for NPCs.)

You can also change the entity type by clicking the character button.
