# Character

For your story, you need to create characters and set a main character.

To access the characters screen, use the command `/nc open character_manager`.

This is where you can create global characters, characters that are accessible from any scene, characters that are important.

You also need to assign a main character.

A main character has more customization options.

A main character can:
- Use the client player's skin.
- Use the client player's name.
- Force the client player's skin to change to its own skin from main character folder.

If you want to create a character that uses the client player's name, you must name it `__username__`.

To change a character's skins, navigate to its folder, then to `skins`, and replace `main.png`.  
You can also add more PNG files as variants of the main skin, which can be used for specific animations of that character.
