# 1.0.0 - Interaction Update

Hello everyone! After 7 months of hard work alone, along with learning Minecraft Modding, **1.0.0** is now available for **1.21.10**, **1.21.1** and **1.20.1**, with a **lot** of new features!

## Interaction

Before, in NarrativeCraft, you could only create a story with no **gameplay** and only cutscenes. It really reduced creativity and immersion, and Minecraft is, above all, a game.

You can add interactions to a character/NPC or objects. When the player targets the interaction, a small eye will pop up to show that it is interactable.
::: tip
If you provide no stitch, the eye will not pop up. It can be useful if you want to add characters in your interaction scene but they do not necessarily need to be interactable.

To make it work, you need to attach a *stitch* to your Ink script (a sub-knot) that the player will execute when interacting with it.

To summon an interaction scene, a tag was created :
```
interaction <summon, remove> %interaction_name%
```

## Area Trigger

Moreover, a very cool feature is the **area trigger**. First, you create the area in your interaction scene, place the two area points, and, like an interaction, attach a stitch.
This way, when the player enters the area, it will play the provided stitch. You can also specify if the area trigger should be triggered only once.

## Main Character

An important change is how you define characters. Before, you could create custom characters with custom skins, but now, since you can move around, you need to define a **main character**.

A main character is exactly like a normal character/NPC. The only difference is that you can specify how the skin will render. There are 3 types:
- The client skin will be overridden with the main character skin.
- The main character skin will use the client skin.
- The main character will use the skin you set in its skins folder.

Also, if you want the main character to be the player, specify the main character name as "\_\_username\_\_". This way, the character will have the player’s name.

## Gameplay Tag
If you want the player to be able to play, you need to write "# gameplay" in your Ink script.
::: warning
When a player triggers an interaction, make sure to add the gameplay tag again at the end of the stitch. Otherwise, the story will stop unexpectedly.
:::

## Text Tag

A new tag has been added, the **Text tag**. This is, for now, the most complete tag.

This tag allows you to render text on the player’s screen, and you can do a lot of things. You can:
- Change color
- Change the position on the screen (top, top_left, bottom, bottom_right...)
- Change the width to break words earlier
- Use text effects like shake or wave
- Set a custom font
- Enable typing (not skippable by the player)
- Fade in and fade out
- Attach a custom sound
- Change the scale

This tag works with IDs. When creating a text, you need to assign an ID to be able to edit it in the next tags.

```
text %id% <create|remove|edit|position|color|scale|spacing|width|fade|fadein|fadeout|type|font|sound> %...values%
```

An example of its use, start at 0:32

### Update

- Scene folder name new pattern: `%chapter_index%_%scene_rank%_%scene_name%`. This way, scenes are sorted by rank in Inky.
- Scene name is now edited in every script file if edited in-game.
- Animated Border Effect

```
border %up% %right% %down% %left% [%color%] [%opacity%] [in %fade_time% [%easing%]]
border <out> %fade_time% [%easing%]
border clear
```

### Fixes

- Sound not removed from Ink tags running even if ended
- Shake not infinite not removed from Ink tags running even if ended
- Better handling of player interaction and position when on a keyframe/camera
- Main screen music stopping when opening main screen options
